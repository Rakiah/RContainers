Lists implementation

a classic implementation of a double linked list, with a reminder on start, end, and a builtin iterator
feel free to change the implementation as you need it, note that it can only takes pointer on a valid
memory area, and DOES NOT COPY the value of the pointer you pass in (yes the element size is purely for
informational utility), please, if you find any bugs, report me them (with the fix if you did it)
also, i would appreciate if you create or suggest any other method that could be helpfull for these lists
there is a description of what every method do at ft_lists.h

note : you will find MANY MANY places where you will be like "but why isnt he calling this method for this ??"
(example list_remove_range(0, list->count) for clear), in one word, optimization
